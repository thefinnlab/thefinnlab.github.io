**Postdocs**: We are not actively recruiting postdocs at this time, but we are always happy to hear from interested individuals who might be a good fit. Please email Emily with your CV and brief cover letter describing your research background, interests, and funding (if available) to ask about opportunities.

**PhD students**: We tentatively plan to recruit 1-2 PhD students to start in fall 2021. Applications are to the [Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/graduate-program-psychological-and-brain-sciences) through the [Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies](https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/), and the deadline is expected to be on or around December 1, 2020. While you are welcome to email Emily to express your interest or ask any questions prior to submitting your application, please note that to maintain fairness for all applicants, all video conversations will be scheduled for *after* the written application deadline. 

**Full-time research assistants**: We are not actively recruiting full-time RAs/lab managers at this time, but please watch this space for potential opportunities.

**Undergraduate part-time research assistants**: The lab will be "open" as of July 2020, but due to the COVID-19 situation, we expect that most or all activities will be virtual for the first several months. Still, we are eager to involve interested undergraduates in our research if and when possible. Please check back as we update our plans in light of information from the College regarding academic year 2020-21. Interested undergrads are also welcome to contact our lab manager (Josefa.M.Equita@Dartmouth.edu).
