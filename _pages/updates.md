**Postdocs**: We are not actively recruiting postdocs at this time, but we are always happy to hear from interested individuals who might be a good fit. Please email Emily with your CV and brief cover letter describing your research background, interests, and funding (if available) to ask about opportunities.

**PhD students**: Emily plans to read applications for the 2024-2025 admissions cycle. Applications are to the [Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/graduate-program-psychological-and-brain-sciences)  through the [Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies](https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/), and the deadline is expected to be on or around December 1, 2024. While you are welcome to email Emily to express your interest, please note that to protect time for current trainees and maintain fairness for all applicants, Emily cannot engage in extended email or video conversations with prospective students prior to the written application deadline. Here are answers to some [FAQs](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/menufeature/graduate/graduate-admissions/admissions-faqs) prepared by the department that may be helpful.
